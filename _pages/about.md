This is the front page of Yuanbo Li's personal website.

I am currently an undergraduate student in University of California, Davis. Major in Mathematics and Computer Science, I am interested in machine learning and also graph theory.

Recently I am reading Convex Optimization by Boyd and Vandenberghe and Graph Theory with Applications by Bondy and Murty, I am glad if you are also interested and want to communicate with me via email :)
