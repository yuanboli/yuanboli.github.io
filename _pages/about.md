This is the front page of Yuanbo Li's personal website.

I am currently an first year Computer Science PhD student in Georgia Institute of Technology mentored by professor Qirun Zhang. My research interests lie in program analysis and graph algorithms. I finished my undergraduate study in University of California, Davis with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science.
